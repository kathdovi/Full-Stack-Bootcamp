        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Kanye West was born in Atlanta, but he grew up in Chicago. He released his first album, The College Dropout, in 2004. Since then, he's released several albums, such as 808s & Heartbreak and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.</p>
        <p>Kanye, otherwise known as Ye or Yeezy, has always been a polarizing figure, but he has caused a significant amount of controversy recently. He still remains winning as one of the best producers of all time, even though his politicking is really not great.</p>
